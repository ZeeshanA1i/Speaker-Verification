# Speaker Verification
Given an audio file containing the speach of a person, our goal is to verify the speaker using deep learning model.

## Getting Started

Since we are working on audio data, it turns out that the Convolutional Neural Networks give better results.

### Prerequisites

You need to install the *librosa* library and here is how to install it.

```
conda install -c conda-forge librosa
```
